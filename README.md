# War Card Game

A simple War card game implemented in Python.

## Objective

The objective of the game is to win all the cards from your opponent.

## Rules

1. Each player gets half of a shuffled 52-card deck.
2. Both players reveal the top card of their deck simultaneously.
3. The higher card wins both cards; if the cards are equal, a "war" occurs.
4. In a war, each player places three cards face down and one card face up. The higher face-up card wins all the cards.
5. The game continues until one player has all the cards.
